# GitHub Workshop

Welcome to GitHub Workshop! This is led and planned by ACM members and alumni to help teach you the basics!

## Why is the ACM teaching this?
We noticed a lack of formal teachings of Git and GitHub in the computer science department. A professor reached out to us to see if we could resolve the issue. 
We looked into potential solutions and attempted to incorperate it into the ciriculum, but there were challeneges with the inital solution. So, we as the ACM decided to simply
host a workshop. It will allow for you all to see some of the things we do in the ACM, and you get to learn the basics, which are necessary for the career field.

## Is this the only time this will be taught?
Nope! We plan to do this ever semester, unless the department is able to incorperate this into the ciruculum. It's a great opportunity for students to teach others and show mastery of 
a topic -- something that'll shine on a resume! 

## Feedback
After attending the workshop, we would love to hear your opinions on how to improve this. As of the Spring semester of 2024, this is completely new. We would like feedback to improve 
this for future students and make teaaching these concepts seamless. Please fill out
